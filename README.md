can't find schematics for it
you have a couple of photos in google photos that show how to plug it in
red x x blue
green black orange white â¬†

how to run:
plug into usb
open serial monitor in arduino ide
Select Generic ESP8266 module for port
Both NL & CR, 115200 baud I think
Pressing buton on breadboard seems to reset

How to program:
Connect yellow GPIO0 wire that dangles to negative (ground)
hold down button on usb-to-serial while plugging it in and let go after 1 second
Press the button on breadboard (reset) and then release and disconnect yellow GPIO0 wire
Press upload

when done disconnect yellow wire, unplug usb and plug back in

# TODO
 - [ ] Use performant types (not uint64_t)
 - [ ] Wrap serial output in ifdef to avoid overhead when not debugging
 - [ ] Measure current draw
 - [ ] Measure performance and see if any optimisations needed
 - [ ] Get whatsapp messages from dad for datasheets and schematics
